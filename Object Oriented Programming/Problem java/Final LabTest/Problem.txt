Implement the missing Rosemary class so that when we run the code above it will print:

Vine
Rosemary:Vanity numLeaves=1024
Rosemary:Pride numLeaves=2048
There are 2 rosemary plants.
Rosemary:Loathing numLeaves=1024
There are 3 rosemary plants.

See the comments in the code for hints on what the various methods and attributes Rosemary must have.
