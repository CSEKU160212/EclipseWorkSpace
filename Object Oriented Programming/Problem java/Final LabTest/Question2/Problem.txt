Implement the missing Lotus class so that when we run the code above it will print:

Vine is a plant 
Lotus:Vanity has 1024 leaves  and it is not spreading smell 
Lotus:Pride has 2048 leaves  and it is spreading smell 
There are 3 plants. 
Lotus:Loathing has 1024 leaves  
There are 3 Lotus plants. 

  Note: Lotus must implement Smell interface
